JNN is a Java library for neural network processing.
The module also defines a neural network exchange format "NNA",
a plain text format used to read and write neural networks.

Changelog:

From 1.6 to 1.7

* Added support for NNs trained and formatted by Helmut Schiller (was formerly located in beam-meris-glint module).
  Code is in package org.esa.beam.nn (todo: use Schiller's original packlage path).
  
  
From 1.5 to 1.6

* JNN is not thread-safe. So we made JnnNet and JnnLayer clonable. Client code can now instantiate
  thread-local copies a net in order to run several net instances in parallel.
