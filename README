JNN is a Java library for neural network processing.
The module also defines a neural network exchange format "NNA",
a plain text format used to read and write neural networks.

Changelog:

From 1.5 to 1.6

* JNN is not thread-safe. So we made JnnNet and JnnLayer clonable. Client code can now produce
  local copies a net in order to run several net instances in parallel.
